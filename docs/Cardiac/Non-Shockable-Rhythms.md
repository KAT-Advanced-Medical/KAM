# Non-Shockable Rhythms

A non-shockable sinus rhythms is when the cause of cardiac arrest isn't related to the electrical activity of the heart, but as a result of another cause (in KAM, it is typically blood loss). This is the most dangerous type of cardiac arrest as the treatment is potentially more time-consuming, meaning there is a greater chance of patient death. The biggest difference between non-shockable rhythms and [shockable rhythms](/Cardiac/Shockable-Rhythms.md) is that the treatment for non-shockable rhythms is the same for both types.

## Pulseless Electrical Activity

Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) is defined as the absence of a pulse in a patient with an otherwise normal cardiac rhythm. This means that an EKG will show them as having a pulse, but there will be no actual heartrate. 

## Asystole

Asystole is defined as the total or near total absence of electrical activity within the heart. This is the worst possible form of cardiac arrest. You can diagnose an asystole rhythm by seeing a flat or nearly flat line on an EKG reading.

## Treating Non-Shockable Rhythms

>[!NOTE]
> These instructions only cover treating the cardiac arrest, they assume you have stopped any major bleeding, have secured the airways, and have an IV and are administering fluid. They also assume you have attached either the AED or AED-X and have confirmed which type of cardiac arrest you are dealing with.

1. Administer CPR for 45 seconds
2. Check for pulse & analyze rhythm
