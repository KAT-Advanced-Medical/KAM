## Description

The AED is used to treat shockable cardiac arrests. In certain situations, it is much more effective to treat cardiac arrest that CPR, especially when combined with drugs such as adenosine and lidocaine.
## How to Use

- Ensure nobody touches the patient (no CPR/ BVM is performed)
- Click on chest
- Attach AED pads in the Advanced Treatment section
- Analyze rhythm in the Examine Patient section:
	- “Shock Advised”: The AED will charge automatically and give a sound notification when ready. It is then possible to perform a shock (Using Epinephrine/Amiodarone/Lidocaine beforehand is advised. One medication per shock). The AED will disarm itself after some time automatically if no shock is administered.
	- “No Shock Advised”:  perform CPR, administer epinephrine (not essential) and check pulse every 2 minutes
- Analyze rhythm after the shock/2 minutes of CPR
